# Load data

Structure: Each line is a ping sent to an Hyperboria node, using Debian's `ping`. Columns are:
* timestamp: timestamp the ping was sent, as reported by ping.
* round_start_timestamp: timestamp the `ping` tool was invoked at.
* node: IPv6 address of the pinged node.
* seq: sequence number, as reported by ping. There is a bug with my script: for nodes that can be pinged, the seq is from 2 to 4, and for nodes which could not be reach it is from 0 to 2. The former should be fixed before analysing data.
* nb_bytes: number of bytes of the ICMP PING, as reported by ping
* ttl: ICMP TTL, as reported by ping
* latency: latency reported by ping.
